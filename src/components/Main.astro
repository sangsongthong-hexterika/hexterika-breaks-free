        <img src="/hexterika-breaks-free/MySelfiePic.jpg" />
        <p>My full legal name is Sangsongthong Chantaranothai. I am a multi-passionate adventurer. I have a lot of passions in different things and I am not afraid to explore them.</p>

        <h1>Why Hexterika? If your name isn't Hexterika, then why name this website as Hexterika?</h1>
        <p>Hexterika is my stage-name and a brand identity that I create. There are so many personal reasons and experiences that makes me not want to use my real legal name. In order to start making meaningful changes in my life, changing the name and creating an identity that does not associate with my past is both empowering and help me mentally brave enough to make those changes true. In order to free myself from my past, I need a name that does not associate with my past self to work toward to.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to dive deep into the personal reasons of why I don't feel empowering from keep using my legal name. However, I want to emphasize that creating this identity empowering me to design and envision what I want to do and who I want to become freely.</p>
        <h3>I didn't come here to vent. I come here to make a different.</h3>
        <p>The name Hexterika is a blend of words. Two names of two different fictional characters. The first character is known for looking forward toward the future and leave the past in the past. While I cannot fully able to do so, I intend to keep looking toward the future and make it a better, brighter, and happier for myself. It's why a part of the name came from this character.</p>
        <p>The second character is known to be very organized. I want to be more organized because it will help me improve myself and keep progressing forward more efficiently.</p>
        <p>This website, Hexterika-Breaks-Free, emphasize my strong desire to break free from my past, break free from traditional belief that people should have only a few interests and they have to be in the same directions so they can be really good at them. I want to break free from that mindset and introduce a more fulfilling lifestyle that you can have as many interests as you want and they don't have to be the same directions all the time.</p>
        <p>Addressing the fact that having only a few interests can make you be really good at them, that is true. However, that vary from one individual to another. I can like multiple things and be only acceptable level at all of them or I can pick only a few to be good at while the rest remain acceptable or maybe I am just happy to do it even though I'm not that good and this isn't wrong; and this type of belief and lifestyle shouldn't be treated as outright terrible, but rather as a choice for each individual to choose their own life path.</p>
